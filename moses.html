pCreating a full-fledged learning app requires a significant amount of code and development. However, I can provide you with a basic structure and some code snippets to get you started.

*App Structure*
Let's assume we're building a learning app with the following features:

- Course catalog
- Course details
- Video lessons
- Quizzes
- Progress tracking

*Frontend Code (React Native)*
```
jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, FlatList, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const [courses, setCourses] = useState([]);
  const [selectedCourse, setSelectedCourse] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchCourses();
  }, []);

  const fetchCourses = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://example.com/api/courses');
      const data = await response.json();
      setCourses(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  const handleCourseSelect = (course) => {
    setSelectedCourse(course);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <FlatList
        data={courses}
        renderItem={({ item }) => (
          <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => handleCourseSelect(item)}>
            <Text>{item.title}</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        )}
        keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
      />
      {selectedCourse && (
        <View>
          <Text>{selectedCourse.title}</Text>
          <VideoPlayer videoUrl={selectedCourse.videoUrl} />
          <Quiz questions={selectedCourse.questions} />
        </View>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

*Backend Code (Node.js)*
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/courses', (req, res) => {
  const courses = [
    { id: 1, title: 'Course 1', videoUrl: 'https://example.com/video1.mp4', questions: [{ id: 1, question: 'What is the capital of France?', answer: 'Paris' }] },
    { id: 2, title: 'Course 2', videoUrl: 'https://example.com/video2.mp4', questions: [{ id: 2, question: 'What is the largest planet in our solar system?', answer: 'Jupiter' }] },
  ];
  res.json(courses);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

This code provides a basic structure for a learning app, including a course catalog, course details, video lessons, and quizzes. You'll need to implement the logic for progress tracking, user authentication, and other features based on your specific requirements.

Please note that this is a basic example and might need adjustments based on your specific requirements.
